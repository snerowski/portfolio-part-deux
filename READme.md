### snerowski.github.io

## Description 
A brand new! sleeker! portfolio! that was built with react! This portfolio is essentially a resume to be used for future employers to come and spec out the work I have done so far! I added both projects I have worked on thus far, list of technologies Ive learned so far, included a brief summary of myself, links to all my contact info, even used a google maps api to display where I live. As well as an active submission box if someone wants to contact me. 

## Installation
Simply go to my GitHub (github.com/snerowski) find the snerowski.github.io, follow the link included in the READme, or just enter snerowski.github.io in the url, since this is deployed with GH-Pages. 

## Usage 
On the site there is a navbar with each category of the portfolio that will direct the user there. The about me section just has my picture and a brief bio. The projects section has both of my projects that are linked to the live webpages of both of them, and when you hover it gives a quick description. The skills and technologies section just has the technologies I have learned thus far, and the links section includes the links to my contact info. Below that has a google maps api that displays my address, then a submission box in case an employer wants to contact me!
